## 🗂️ Project Structure

### 1. 🔧 Database & Table Creation

```sql
CREATE DATABASE Retail_sales_analysis;

CREATE TABLE retail_sales(
      transactions_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
	  sale_date DATE,	
	  sale_time TIME,
	  customer_id INT,
	  gender VARCHAR(15),
	  age INT,
	  category VARCHAR(15),
	  quantity INT,
	  price_per_unit FLOAT,

### 2. 🧹 Data Cleaning & Exploration

- Count total records and unique values
- Identify and remove nulls

```sql
-- Total records
SELECT *
FROM retail_sales;
------------------Find Null data
SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE sale_date IS NUll

SELECT * FROM retail_sales
WHERE

	sale_time IS NULL
	OR
	customer_id IS NULL
	OR
	gender	age IS NULL
	OR
	category IS NULL
	OR
	quantiy IS NULL
	OR
	price_per_unit IS NULL
	OR
	cogs IS NULL
	OR
	total_sale IS NULL;

-----------------Delete the null data
DELETE * retail_sales
WHERE
	sale_time IS NULL
	OR
	customer_id IS NULL
	OR
	gender IS NULL
	OR
	age IS NULL
	OR
	category IS NULL
	OR

	 COUNT(*)AS total_orders
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY 1;

FROM 
(    
SELECT 
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) as year,
    EXTRACT(MONTH FROM sale_date) as month,
    AVG(total_sale) as avg_sale,
    RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY EXTRACT(YEAR FROM sale_date) ORDER BY AVG(total_sale) DESC) as rank
FROM retail_sales
GROUP BY 1, 2
